# Create a 3 slide presentation using [Webslides](https://webslides.tv/#slide=1)

In `presentation.html` there is a 3 slide template for working with the Javascript library Webslides.

Customize the first and third slides for yourself and create the second slide from scratch using the [Webslides components examples](https://webslides.tv/demos/components#slide=3).
